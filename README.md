# 245_Assignment1
MovieTags.java is a project for CS245 Data Structures and Algorithms. The objective of this project is to demonstrate mastery of object oriented design, searching and sorting algorithms by handling a large dataset efficiently with respect to time and space. This is done by reading a csv file which contains information on movies. The program takes the data, sorts it, and prints the three most and three least popular movie tags. Furthermore, the user can search for specific information, by movie tag or occurrences of a movie tag, that they would like to find.
